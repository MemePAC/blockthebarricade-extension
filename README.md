# Block the barricade


## Purpose

Allow users who are done with celebrity bullshit and feeding into their influencer status to drop them all in one click for each site they are on so they dont have to think about who is a celebrity vs. a normal person.

The database should not only block the celebs personal gloating and bragging account, but expand into knowledge about influencer company brands and block those accounts as well as big businesses and corporations.

## Target social media .coms

 * Facebook
 * Instagram
 * TikTok
 * Threads
 * Youtube
 * X/Twitter

Maybe?
  
 * Linkedin
 * Reddit
 * Twitch

## Data Set Links

So far, I have yet to find any data set linking all of the various platform URLs for any given celebrity aside from one instagram one.  My best idea is using imdbs massive database and joining the vote count and sorting and filtering dead people who are not active on social media obviously
